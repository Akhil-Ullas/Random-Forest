🌲 What is a Random Forest and What Does It Do?
Random Forest is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple Decision Trees to produce more stable and accurate predictions.

Each tree is trained on:

a random subset of data

a random subset of features

Final predictions are made through:

majority voting (classification)

averaging (regression)

This reduces overfitting, improves robustness, and delivers stronger generalization compared to a single decision tree.

✔ Advantages of Random Forest

More robust and stable than individual Decision Trees

Handles complex feature interactions and non-linear relationships

Works well with both categorical and numerical features

Provides feature importance insights

Performs strongly with minimal hyperparameter tuning

✘ Disadvantages of Random Forest

Less interpretable than a single Decision Tree

Larger model size and higher computation cost

Slower inference in comparison to simpler models

Harder to trace individual decision paths
